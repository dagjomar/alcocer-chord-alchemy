## About

The "Alcocer Idea" Chord Generator is a simple web application that helps create chord progressions. It was built as a hobby project to easily generate some musical ideas when I get stuck with the same old patterns. This tool is inspired by Gibran Alcocer's "Idea" songs - those short, catchy chord progressions that get stuck in your head. The name "Alcocer Ideas" comes from that concept of simple but effective musical ideas.
